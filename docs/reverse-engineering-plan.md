# Taiga Reverse Engineering Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive reverse engineering documentation for the Taiga project management system. The documentation will include various UML diagrams to illustrate the system's structure, behavior, and interactions.

## 1. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

### Scope
- Core entities and their relationships
- Key attributes for each entity
- Relationship cardinalities

### Main Entities
1. Users
2. Projects
3. Workspaces
4. Stories
5. Workflows
6. Comments
7. Attachments
8. Roles & Permissions

## 2. Activity Diagram

### Key Workflows
1. Project Management Flow
   - Project creation
   - Team member invitation
   - Role assignment
   - Project configuration

2. Story Management Flow
   - Story creation
   - Assignment
   - Status updates
   - Comments and attachments

3. Workspace Collaboration Flow
   - Workspace creation
   - Project organization
   - Team management

## 3. Sequence Diagram

### Key Interactions
1. Authentication Flow
   - User login
   - Token management
   - Permission validation

2. Project Management Flow
   - Project creation sequence
   - Member invitation process
   - Role assignment sequence

3. Story Management Flow
   - Story creation and assignment
   - Status updates and notifications
   - Comment thread interactions

## 4. Class Diagram

### Core Components
1. Domain Models
   - User
   - Project
   - Workspace
   - Story
   - Workflow
   - Comment
   - Attachment

2. Services Layer
   - AuthService
   - ProjectService
   - WorkspaceService
   - StoryService
   - NotificationService

3. Repository Layer
   - Base repositories
   - Entity-specific repositories

4. API Layer
   - Controllers/Routes
   - Serializers
   - Validators

## Implementation Plan

1. Create ER Diagram
   - Use Mermaid for visualization
   - Focus on core entities first
   - Add supporting entities
   - Document relationships and cardinalities

2. Develop Activity Diagrams
   - Create separate diagrams for each main workflow
   - Include decision points and parallel activities
   - Document error paths and edge cases

3. Design Sequence Diagrams
   - Create detailed interaction flows
   - Include all relevant components
   - Document async operations and events

4. Build Class Diagram
   - Start with core domain models
   - Add service layer interactions
   - Include repository patterns
   - Document API interfaces

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we include integration patterns with external services (GitHub, GitLab, Google)?
2. Do we need to document the event system architecture separately?
3. Should we include the task queue system in the diagrams?
4. How detailed should we document the permission system?
